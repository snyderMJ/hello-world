# hello-world
Learning GitHub and a place to keep ideas for projects!
My name is Michael Snyder.  I am a Computer Science student at the University of Oregon Online Post-Bacc program. 
I would like to work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence development. 
Currently working on freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification.  I have worked with C, C++, Node.js, HTML, CSS and bootstrap to create basic projects for classes in my CS program.  I am looking to learn Python as well for data science, machine learning and AI applications.
I am hoping to get involved in some open-source software projects to start getting experience and to help contribute to the community.
